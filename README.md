Welcome to my **90-Day LeetCode Challenge**!  
This repository is part of my daily effort to solve **3 LeetCode problems every day**—a mix of Easy, Medium, and Hard challenges—to build strong skills in **Data Structures & Algorithms**.

## 📅 Challenge Overview
- **Start Date:** May 1, 2025
- **End Date:** July 29, 2025
- **Goal:** Solve 3 problems every day for 90 days (Total: 270 problems!)
- **Focus:** 
  - Easy: Strengthen problem-solving basics
  - Medium: Improve algorithms and problem-solving strategies
  - Hard: Master advanced DSA techniques

## 📊 Progress Tracker

This tracker includes the problems I solve each day, along with links to their solutions and my learning outcomes.

## 🛠️ Tools and Languages Used
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript
- **Tools:** LeetCode, VS Code, GitHub
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub for code management and tracking
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code

## 🔥 My Approach
Each day, I will:
- **Solve 3 problems**: One from Easy, Medium, and Hard categories.
- **Document my solution**: For each problem, I’ll explain my approach, the challenges I faced, and the optimization techniques I used.
- **Track my progress**: Each solution will be recorded and linked in the **Progress Tracker** Excel sheet.

## 📌 How You Can Follow the Challenge
- **LinkedIn Updates**: I will be sharing daily updates on LinkedIn to keep my network informed about my progress.
- **GitHub Repository**: This repository will have all my solved problems, organized by day and difficulty level.
